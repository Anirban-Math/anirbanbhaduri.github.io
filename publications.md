My research primarily focuses on Derived categories, Noncommutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Representation Theory. I like to think about questions which relates Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry to the classical one. Studying derived categories of algebraic and geometric objects using homological methods also excites me.
Here is a link to my [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Bhaduri,+A) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g0sp4GcAAAAJ&hl=en).
