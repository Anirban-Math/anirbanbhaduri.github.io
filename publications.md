My research primarily focuses on Derived categories, Noncommutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Representation Theory. I like to think about questions which relates Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry to the classical one. Studying derived categories of algebraic and geometric objects using homological methods also excites me.
